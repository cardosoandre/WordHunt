## Description

WordHunt is a recreation of the classic word search game in Unity. The game takes a list of words and procedurally inserts them on the grid, and all of that using Unity's Canvas System. My main goal while developing this was making sure that most variables and options could be tweaked at any time.

* Set if **inversed words** are valid (for diagonal, horizontal and vertical)
* You can **filter** bad words and you can also edit the list from the badwords
* You can change the **grid size** amount of rows and columns
* you can change the **spacing** between the grid cells
